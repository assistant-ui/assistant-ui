## Architecture

```
@assistant-ui/tap          → Zero-dep reactive primitives (tapState, tapEffect, etc.)
@assistant-ui/store        → Bridges tap with React (useAui, useAuiState, AuiProvider)
@assistant-ui/core         → Shared primitives and types for React + React Native
@assistant-ui/react        → Web distribution (re-exports core + adds Radix primitives)
@assistant-ui/react-native → RN distribution (re-exports core + adds RN primitives)
@assistant-ui/react-ink    → Ink/terminal distribution
```

## Changesets

Every PR that changes a published package needs a changeset. Always use **patch** — minor/major require maintainer approval. Private packages (`@assistant-ui/docs`, `@assistant-ui/shadcn-registry`) are exempt.

## Lint / format (oxlint + oxfmt)

Lint with `pnpm lint`, autofix with `pnpm lint:fix`. Backed by `.oxlintrc.json` (oxlint) and `.oxfmtrc.json` (oxfmt).

Known gap from the Biome era: oxlint's `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` only understands the built-in React hooks. The custom `tapEffect` / `tapMemo` / `tapCallback` / `tapConst` / `tapResources` dependency tracking that Biome enforced is **not** checked. Review tap dep arrays manually; remember `tapEffectEvent` returns a stable value and `tapState`'s setter is stable.

## Package boundaries

`@assistant-ui/core` contains shared code. It has a `./react` sub-path that both `@assistant-ui/react` and `@assistant-ui/react-native` re-export from. Customers never install core directly — they use one of the three distribution packages (react, react-native, react-ink).

`@assistant-ui/ui` contains shadcn-style components that get copied into user projects. We use them directly in the monorepo to avoid duplication.

There is an ongoing migration from the legacy runtime architecture to a tap-only architecture.
