"setup-agent": minor

Fetch the agent's instructions from the setup server. Commands that print guidance get the briefing, the stream's messages, the next-command hints and the relayed questions from `<setup-url>/guide`. A wording fix now ships with a server deploy instead of waiting for people to upgrade. Setup is online-only: without the guide a command fails with `Setup needs internet access to <url>`. The guide is data. The CLI strips control characters, fills placeholders itself, refuses redirects and guides over 256 KB, and runs only the `print`, `print-status` and `announce-agent` steps.

<!-- caret-break: intended -->
Removed `agentInstructions`, `INSTRUCTIONS` and `AgentInstructionsOptions` from `setup-agent/cli`, since the text now lives on the server. `diffEvents` and `followSetup` take the guide.
