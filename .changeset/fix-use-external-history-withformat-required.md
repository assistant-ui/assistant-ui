fix: `useAISDKRuntime` now throws when the supplied `ThreadHistoryAdapter` omits `withFormat`, instead of silently dropping all history load/append/update calls. The optional-call chain `historyAdapter.withFormat?.(…).load()` previously short-circuited to `undefined`. The `withFormat`-wrapped adapter is now memoized instead of recomputed on every persist.
