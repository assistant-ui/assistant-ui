title: Tambo Parity Stage 1
description: Deterministic component lifecycle/state replay with instanceId + aui-state patch semantics.
---

import { TamboParityStage1 } from "@/components/examples/tambo-parity-stage-1";

Stage 1 establishes deterministic read-path behavior for component lifecycle
and state synchronization.

## What this stage guarantees

- `component.instanceId` is required and used as the state key.
- `metadata.unstable_state.components[instanceId]` is the canonical storage
  location.
- Patch protocol is `aui-state` `v1` with only `set` and `append-text`.
- Per-instance `seq` is monotonic. Updates apply only when
  `incomingSeq > currentSeq`.
- Stale patches are dropped deterministically.

## Runnable replay demo

The demo below replays a Stage 1 fixture sequence:

1. mount component `card_1` (`seq=1`, `lifecycle=mounting`)
2. apply `seq=2` patch (`lifecycle=active`, append `state.summary`)
3. drop stale `seq=1` patch trying to set `lifecycle=complete`

## Bridge migration notes

When migrating existing `@tambo-ai/react` bridge code to Stage 1 semantics:

1. emit `instanceId` on every component part
2. write component state under `components/<instanceId>/...`
3. include numeric `seq` in each patch batch
4. keep operation set limited to `set` and `append-text` for `aui-state` `v1`

See the bridge guide for compatibility boundaries and caveats:
