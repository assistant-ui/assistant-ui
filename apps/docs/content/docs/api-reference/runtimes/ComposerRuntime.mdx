The composer runtime allows you to view or edit anything related to how new information is added and sent. For instance you can use the composer runtime to read the state, add attachments, update text, send a message, etc.

import { ParametersTable } from "@/components/docs";
import { ComposerState } from "@/components/docs/parameters/context";
import { ComposerRuntime, threadComposerRuntime } from "@/generated/typeDocs";

### `useComposer`

Grabs the nearest composer state (whether it’s the edit composer or the thread’s new message composer):

```tsx
// Example
import { useComposer } from "@assistant-ui/react";

const composerRuntime = useComposer();

// set the text
composerRuntime.setText("Hello from the composer runtime");

// send whatever is in the composer 
composerRuntime.send();

// get the current text in the composer state
const composerState = composerRuntime.getState();
const currentText = composerState.text;

```

<ParametersTable {...ComposerRuntime} />


### `useThreadComposer`

Access the thread’s new message composer state:

```tsx
import { useThreadComposer } from "@assistant-ui/react";

const threadComposerRuntime = useThreadComposer();

// set the text
threadComposerRuntime.setText("Hello from the thread composer runtime");

// send whatever is in the thread composer 
threadComposerRuntime.send();

// get the current text in the composer state
const threadComposerState = threadComposerRuntime.getState();
const currentText = threadComposerRuntime.text;

```

<ParametersTable {...threadComposerRuntime} />
