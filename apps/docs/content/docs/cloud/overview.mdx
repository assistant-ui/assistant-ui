title: Overview
---

Assistant Cloud is a hosted service built for assistant-ui frontends that offers comprehensive thread management and message history. It automatically persists threads, supports human-in-the-loop workflows, and integrates with common auth providers to seamlessly allow users to resume conversations at any point.


## Features

### Thread management

Using our `<ThreadList />` component, show the users a list of conversations. Allow the users to seamlessly switch between conversations and even let long running tasks run in the background.

Assistant Cloud automatically persists a list of threads and corresponding metadata. It also automatically generates a title for conversations based on the initial messages.

Supported backends:

- AI SDK
- LangGraph
- Custom

### Chat history

For every conversation, Assistant Cloud can store the history of messages, allowing the user to resume the conversation at any point in time.
This supports human in the loop workflows, where the execution of an agent is interrupted until user feedback is collected.

Supported backends:

- AI SDK
- LangGraph
- Custom (currently only Local Runtime)

### Authorization

Assistant Cloud integrates with your auth provider (Clerk, Auth0, Supabase, Firebase, ...) to identify your users and authorize them to access just the conversations they are allowed to see.

Supported auth providers:

- Clerk
- Auth0
- Supabase
- Firebase
- Your own

## Getting Started

To get started, create an account at [Assistant Cloud Dashboard](https://cloud.assistant-ui.com/) and follow one of the walkthroughs for your preferred backend:

- [AI SDK](/docs/cloud/persistence/ai-sdk)
- [LangGraph](/docs/cloud/persistence/langgraph)

You can also check out our example repositories to see how to integrate Assistant Cloud with your frontend:

## Implementation Details

### Cloud Integration with LocalRuntime

For LocalRuntime users, Assistant Cloud provides seamless thread management:

```tsx
import { AssistantCloud } from "@assistant-ui/cloud";
import { useLocalRuntime } from "@assistant-ui/react";

const cloud = new AssistantCloud({
  apiKey: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ASSISTANT_CLOUD_API_KEY,
});

export function MyRuntimeProvider({ children }) {
  const runtime = useLocalRuntime(MyModelAdapter, {
    cloud, // Enables multi-thread support and persistence
  });

  return (
    <AssistantRuntimeProvider runtime={runtime}>
      {children}
    </AssistantRuntimeProvider>
  );
}
```

### Authentication Setup

Assistant Cloud works with any authentication provider that can generate JWTs:

```tsx
// Example with Clerk
import { useAuth } from "@clerk/nextjs";

export function useAssistantCloudAuth() {
  const { getToken } = useAuth();
  
  return {
    getAccessToken: () => getToken({ template: "assistant-cloud" }),
  };
}

const cloud = new AssistantCloud({
  apiKey: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ASSISTANT_CLOUD_API_KEY,
  auth: useAssistantCloudAuth(),
});
```

### Thread List Integration

Display and manage multiple conversations:

```tsx
import { ThreadList } from "@assistant-ui/react";

export function MyApp() {
  return (
    <div className="flex h-screen">
      {/* Sidebar with thread list */}
      <div className="w-64 border-r">
        <ThreadList />
      </div>
      
      {/* Main chat area */}
      <div className="flex-1">
        <Thread />
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Configuration Options

```tsx
const cloud = new AssistantCloud({
  // Required: Your Assistant Cloud API key
  apiKey: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ASSISTANT_CLOUD_API_KEY,
  
  // Optional: Custom base URL for self-hosted instances
  baseURL: "https://your-instance.assistant-ui.com",
  
  // Optional: Authentication provider
  auth: {
    getAccessToken: () => getToken(),
  },
  
  // Optional: Custom user identification
  userId: "user_123",
  
  // Optional: Organization/workspace isolation
  organizationId: "org_456",
});
```

## Comparison with Self-Hosted

| Feature | Assistant Cloud | Self-Hosted |
|---------|----------------|-------------|
| Setup Time | < 5 minutes | Hours to days |
| Maintenance | Zero | Ongoing |
| Scaling | Automatic | Manual |
| Security | SOC 2 certified | Your responsibility |
| Cost | Predictable monthly | Infrastructure + time |
| Customization | Standard features | Full control |

## Migration from Self-Hosted

If you're currently using custom thread management, migrating to Assistant Cloud is straightforward:

```tsx
// Before: Custom thread management
const runtime = useRemoteThreadListRuntime({
  adapter: myCustomAdapter,
  runtimeHook: () => useLocalRuntime(modelAdapter),
});

// After: Assistant Cloud
const cloud = new AssistantCloud({ apiKey: "..." });
const runtime = useLocalRuntime(modelAdapter, { cloud });
```

Your existing `LocalRuntime` configuration remains unchanged - just add the `cloud` option to enable managed persistence.
