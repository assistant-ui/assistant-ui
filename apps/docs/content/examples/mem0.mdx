## Overview

The Mem0 example demonstrates how to integrate assistant-ui with Mem0 for persistent memory across conversations. This creates a personalized AI experience that remembers user preferences, facts, and context from previous interactions.

## Features

- **Persistent Memory**: AI remembers user preferences and facts across sessions
- **Personalization**: Tailored responses based on user history and preferences
- **Memory Management**: Users can view, edit, and manage their stored memories
- **Context Continuity**: Conversations build upon previous interactions
- **Privacy Controls**: Users can control what information is remembered
- **Memory Visualization**: Clear interface for managing stored memories

## Usage

To implement memory-enabled chat:

1. **Mem0 Integration**: Set up Mem0 SDK for memory management
2. **Memory Context**: Provide user memories to the AI context
3. **Memory UI**: Create interface for users to manage their memories
4. **Privacy Controls**: Implement controls for memory visibility and deletion
5. **Context Injection**: Automatically include relevant memories in conversations

## Code

Key implementation components:

- **Memory Provider**: Mem0 integration for storing and retrieving memories
- **Context Management**: Automatic inclusion of relevant memories in AI context
- **Memory UI**: Interface for users to view and manage their memories
- **Privacy Controls**: Settings for memory visibility and retention
- **Session Continuity**: Persistent memory across chat sessions

The implementation uses Mem0's memory management system with assistant-ui for a seamless personalized experience.
