## Overview

The LangGraph Stockbroker example demonstrates how to integrate assistant-ui with LangGraph for complex, multi-step workflows that require human-in-the-loop interactions. This example shows a stock trading assistant that can execute trades with user approval.

## Features

- **Multi-step Workflows**: Complex workflows managed by LangGraph
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: User approval required for critical actions
- **State Management**: Persistent state across workflow steps
- **Tool Integration**: Integration with external APIs and services
- **Approval Workflows**: Clear approval interfaces for sensitive operations
- **Workflow Visualization**: Visual representation of workflow progress

## Usage

To implement LangGraph workflows with assistant-ui:

1. **LangGraph Setup**: Configure LangGraph workflows and state management
2. **Tool Integration**: Connect LangGraph tools with assistant-ui components
3. **Approval Interfaces**: Create UI for human approval of critical actions
4. **State Persistence**: Maintain workflow state across interactions
5. **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling and recovery

## Code

Key implementation aspects:

- **LangGraph Integration**: Use LangGraph for workflow orchestration
- **Tool Components**: Create UI components for LangGraph tools
- **Approval UI**: Interface for user approval of sensitive operations
- **State Management**: Persistent state management across workflow steps
- **Error Recovery**: Proper error handling and workflow recovery

The implementation uses LangGraph's workflow capabilities with assistant-ui for a seamless human-AI collaboration experience.
