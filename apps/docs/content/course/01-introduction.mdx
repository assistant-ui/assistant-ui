# Introduction to Assistant UI

Assistant UI is a React component library specifically designed for building AI chat interfaces. Unlike generic chat libraries, it's built from the ground up to handle the unique requirements of AI conversations.

## Why Assistant UI?

### Built for AI
- **Tool Calling**: Native support for function calling and interactive tools
- **Streaming**: Optimized for real-time AI response streaming
- **Attachments**: Handle files, images, and documents seamlessly
- **Speech**: Built-in speech-to-text and text-to-speech capabilities

### Developer Experience
- **Type Safe**: Full TypeScript support with comprehensive type definitions
- **Composable**: Primitive-based architecture for maximum flexibility
- **Framework Agnostic**: Works with any AI backend or service
- **Production Ready**: Used by companies building AI products at scale

### Architecture Advantages
- **Layered Design**: Clear separation between UI, state, and runtime
- **Headless Core**: Use your own components or the provided ones
- **State Management**: Sophisticated state handling built for AI conversations
- **Performance**: Optimized for large conversation histories

## What Makes AI Chat Different?

Traditional chat applications don't handle:
- **Streaming responses** that arrive token by token
- **Tool/function calling** with complex UI interactions
- **Message editing and regeneration**
- **Branching conversations**
- **Large conversation contexts**
- **File attachments with AI processing**

Assistant UI solves all these challenges with purpose-built components and patterns.
